# Logs-for-Dogs

This app is used to create cards containing a dog breed name, description, and random image associated with the dog breed.

To know which dog breeds are searchable, users can click on the instructions tab on the navbar.

After learning which breeds are searchable, users can go back to the main page and enter a breed into the search bar.

After entering a searchable breed into the search bar, a card containing the breed name, description, and random image will be added. 

Additionally, a clear button will be displayed, that allows users to clear the card(s).

If the user leaves the webpage and comes back, the added cards will remain.
